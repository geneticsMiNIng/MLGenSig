\item{data1}{data frame consisting the data from methylation or expresion}

\item{condition}{condition for groups}

\item{names}{number of values we want to mark on plot; in this case we decide to mark values with the smallest differences between means in groups.}

plot of p-values

\description{
Function \code{means_plot} draws a plot with p-values from methylation when we use the t-test. We testing the equality of means in given two groups.
